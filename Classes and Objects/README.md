# Classes and Objects


## What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
In Python, a class is a blueprint that defines a set of attributes and methods that objects will have. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class with their own unique set of attributes and methods. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects represent specific instances of that structure with their own unique values. To create and manage instances of a class, you use the class constructor method to initialize the attributes of the object and set their default values.





## Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case and returns a value. It is often used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar sub-problems. An example of a recursive function in Python is one that calculates the factorial of a given number. Best practices for implementing a recursive function include identifying the base case, ensuring progress towards the base case, using appropriate data structures, and testing with different inputs.




## What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fixtures are functions that provide a fixed baseline for a test run by supplying data and resources to the tests. Code coverage is a metric that measures how much of the source code is covered by the tests.

Using pytest fixtures and code coverage together can improve the quality and maintainability of a project by ensuring that tests have access to consistent and predictable data and resources, and by identifying areas of the code that are not adequately tested.

Fixtures can be used to create a consistent environment for tests to run in, such as setting up a database connection or initializing a class instance. Code coverage can be used to identify parts of the code that are not covered by the tests, so that additional tests can be added to improve the quality of the code.

By using fixtures and code coverage together, developers can ensure that tests are reliable, consistent, and provide comprehensive coverage of the code. This can lead to higher quality and more maintainable code in the long run.
