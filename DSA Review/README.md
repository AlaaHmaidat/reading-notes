### Key Pieces of Advice from "Whiteboard Advice" Reading Assignment:

- Communicate effectively: Restate the question to ensure a clear understanding, ask about edge cases and test cases, and discuss your pseudocode with the interviewer to demonstrate your problem-solving approach.

- Take your time: Avoid rushing into problem-solving right away. Take a moment to think through the problem before starting to write code.

- Write pseudocode first: Instead of immediately writing code, start with pseudocode to outline your approach. This helps ensure your logic is correct before diving into actual coding.

- Ask for help when needed: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or hints if you encounter difficulties during the interview.

- Be open to feedback: Accept any criticism gracefully and use it as an opportunity to improve your approach.

- Come prepared: Make use of your preparation time to understand the interview format, practice problem-solving, and review important concepts.
