# Django Custom User

## The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model
The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model are flexibility, scalability, improved authentication, integration capabilities, and extensibility.

The default user model in Django uses a username to uniquely identify a user during authentication. If you'd rather use an email address, you'll need to create a custom user model by either subclassing `AbstractUser` or `AbstractBaseUser`.

Options:

1. AbstractUser: Use this option if you are happy with the existing fields on the user model and just want to remove the username field.
2. AbstractBaseUser: Use this option if you want to start from scratch by creating your own, completely new user model.


## The process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields

### **Setup**
To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

create and navigate into a dedicated directory called for example `accounts` for our code
- install Django
- make a new Django project called `django_project`
- make a new app `accounts`
- start the local web server

Here are the commands to run:

```
# Windows
> cd onedrive\desktop\code
> mkdir pages
> cd pages
> python -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(.venv) > python -m pip install django~=4.0.0
(.venv) > django-admin startproject django_project .
(.venv) > python manage.py startapp accounts
(.venv) > python manage.py runserver

# macOS
% cd ~/desktop/code
% mkdir pages
% cd pages
% python3 -m venv .venv
% source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) % python3 -m pip install django~=4.0.0
(.venv) % django-admin startproject django_project .
(.venv) % python3 manage.py startapp accounts
(.vent) % python3 manage.py runserver
```
Note that we did not run `migrate` to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

If you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 youâ€™ll see the Django welcome screen.

For now, stop the local server with `Control+c` because otherwise it will start kicking off lots of errors as we implement a custom user model.

### Custom User Model
Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

- update django_project/settings.py
- create a new CustomUser model
- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
- update the admin

In `settings.py` we'll add the accounts app and use the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in `User` model. We'll call our custom user model `CustomUser`.

Within `INSTALLED_APPS` add `accounts` at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` config.

```python
# django_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "accounts",  # new
]
...
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.CustomUser"  # new
```

Now update `accounts/models.py` with a new User model which we'll call `CustomUser`.

```python
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```
We need new versions of two form methods that receive heavy use working with users. Stop the local server with `Control+c` and create a new file in the `accounts` app called `forms.py`.
```
(accounts) $ touch accounts/forms.py
```

We'll update it with the following code to largely subclass the existing forms.

```python
# accounts/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm

from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ("username", "email")

class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ("username", "email")
```

Finally we update `admin.py` since the Admin is highly coupled to the default User model.

```python
# accounts/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ["email", "username",]

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```

And we're done! We can now run `makemigrations` and `migrate` for the first time to create a new database that uses the custom user model.
```
(.venv) > python manage.py makemigrations accounts
(.venv) > python manage.py migrate
```
