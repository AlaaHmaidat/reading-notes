## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
My unique perspective, attention to detail, drive to succeed, and adaptability make me a valuable asset to any potential employer.


## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
To tackle a challenging problem, I utilize a problem-solving approach that involves simplifying the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and solving each part separately. This approach helps me to focus on each individual piece of the puzzle, and to identify any potential roadblocks. Additionally, when I encounter difficult roadblocks, I'm not afraid to ask for help, whether that be from a colleague, online forum, or other resources. I believe that seeking help and working collaboratively can be an effective way to overcome challenges and find solutions to difficult problems.
