### What is Graph Data Structure?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### What are the Types Of Graph

1. Null Graph
A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in the graph.

2. Trivial Graph
Graph having only a single vertex, it is also the smallest graph possible.

3. Undirected Graph
A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge. 

4. Directed Graph
A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

5. Connected Graph
The graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph. 

6. Disconnected Graph
The graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph.

7. Regular Graph
The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to K is called K regular graph.

8. Complete Graph
The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.

9. Cycle Graph
The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree of each vertex is 2. 

10. Cyclic Graph
A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

11. Directed Acyclic Graph
A Directed Graph that does not contain any cycle. 

12. Bipartite Graph
A graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between them.

13. Weighted Graph

- A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. 
- Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs.
