# Permissions & Postgresql

- Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions:
DRF permissions are used to secure an API by controlling access to different views or resources. They consist of permission classes and permission policies. Permission classes define rules for granting or denying access, such as IsAuthenticated or IsAdminUser. Permission policies specify which permission classes to apply. By using DRF permissions, you can restrict access to authenticated users, specific roles or groups, or certain actions within the API.

- SQL SELECT Statement:
The SELECT statement is used in SQL to retrieve data from a database table. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the query: SELECT * FROM employees;. This fetches all rows and columns from the 'employees' table.

- DRF Generic Views:
DRF Generic Views are pre-implemented views provided by DRF for common CRUD operations in a RESTful API. Examples include ListAPIView for retrieving a list of objects, RetrieveAPIView for retrieving a single object, and CreateAPIView for creating new objects. These views reduce repetitive code and simplify API development by providing common functionalities.
