# How to use Random Module: 
The Random module in Python provides various functions for generating random numbers, sequences, and choosing random items from lists. It can be used for simulations, games, cryptography, and more.

# What is Risk Analysis: 
Risk analysis is a process of identifying, assessing, and evaluating potential risks to determine the likelihood of negative events occurring and their potential impact. It is commonly used in business, finance, and project management to help make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks.

# Test Coverage: 
Test coverage is a metric that measures the degree to which a software application has been tested. It is used to determine the percentage of code that has been executed by a test suite and to identify areas of the code that have not been tested.

# Python Random: 
Python's Random module provides a variety of functions for generating random numbers, including integers, floats, and sequences. It can also be used for shuffling lists, selecting random items, and simulating random events.

# What is Dependency Injection:
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows objects to be loosely coupled by providing dependencies through external sources rather than creating them internally. It helps to separate concerns and make code more modular and testable.
