# Python Technical Questions

## Fundamentals of Python:
1. What various Python data types are there?

- Numeric Types: int (integer) and float (floating-point).
- Sequence Types: str (string), list (ordered collection), and tuple (immutable ordered collection).
- Mapping Type: dict (dictionary: collection of key-value pairs).
- Set Types: set (unordered collection of unique elements) and frozenset (immutable set).
- Boolean Type: bool (represents True or False).
- None Type: None (represents absence of value or null value).

2. How do you handle control flow in Python? if, else, for, while, etc.

- If Statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

- If-Else Statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true, otherwise executes an alternative block of code.

- For Loop: Iterates over a sequence or iterable and executes a block of code for each element.

- While Loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

- Break Statement: Terminates the current loop prematurely.

- Continue Statement: Skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.

3. Explain the concept of functions in Python?   
Functions in Python are named blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Functions can accept input parameters, and they can return values using the return statement. Functions promote code reusability, help organize code into logical units, and improve code readability and maintainability.

4. What are the fundamentals of Python object-oriented programming?
