"Lifting state up" means moving the data from a child component to its parent component in React. This helps in managing data flow and sharing data between components.

- Optimize performance using built-in React features like memoization and shouldComponentUpdate/React.memo.

By following these principles, developers create simpler, maintainable, and efficie
